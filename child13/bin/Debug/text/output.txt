This game is set in a place sort of like modern-day Japan but also not. Any
resemblance to real places, entities, and persons living or dead is purely
coincidental. Do HOT try any of the more extreme or depressing actions.
Some scenes may have intense flashing, and some can be violent and
emotionally painful. Please take a break if it messes with you mentally!
Before you begin playing, please bear in mind that at the end of the day,
this game is a piece of fiction and may not necessarily reflect real life.
You read this warning properly, right? Promise?
